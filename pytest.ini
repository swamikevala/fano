# IMPORTANT: pool/tests and llm/tests must be run SEPARATELY due to
# conflicting src/ module names (both have src/models.py).
#
# Run tests with:
#   pytest pool/tests/     - Pool service tests (119 tests)
#   pytest llm/tests/      - LLM library tests (140 tests)
#   pytest tests/          - All other tests
#
# Do NOT run pool/tests and llm/tests together - this will cause import conflicts.
# Use scripts/run_tests.sh for the full test suite with proper isolation.
