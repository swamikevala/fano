The human body is essentially a play of five elements. Your body is 72% water, 12% earth, 6% air, 4% fire, and 6% space. If you understand the mechanics of the five elements within you, you know everything about the whole cosmos.

Water is the largest component because it is the most fundamental element for life. Without the right proportion of water, the body cannot conduct its functions. Earth gives structure and substance. Air moves through you constantly, not just as breath but in every cell. Fire is the transformative principle - digestion, metabolism, the very warmth of life. Space is what makes everything else possible; it is the canvas on which the other elements play.

These proportions are not arbitrary. They reflect a deeper cosmic harmony. The same proportions appear in other natural systems. Understanding this is key to understanding both the body and the universe.
