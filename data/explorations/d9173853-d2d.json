      "prompt": "You are exploring deep mathematical connections between:\n- Fano plane incidence geometry (7 points, 7 lines, 3 points per line)\n- Sanskrit grammar (particularly Panini's system)\n- Indian classical music theory (swaras, shrutis, ragas)\n\nYour goal is to find mathematical structures that:\n1. Feel NATURAL and INEVITABLE (not forced)\n2. Are ELEGANT and SYMMETRIC\n3. DECODE the specific numbers in the teachings below\n\nFollow your mathematical curiosity. Let the structure reveal itself.\nIf something feels forced, abandon it. If something feels inevitable,\npursue it\u2014even if it seems unrelated to anything practical.\n\nThe criterion for a good direction is: does this feel DISCOVERED\nrather than INVENTED? Does it explain WHY the numbers are what they are,\nnot just THAT they match?\n\n=== SOURCE TEACHINGS ===\n\n[On the Five Elements and Body Composition] (Sadhguru - Inner Engineering (Chapter on Pancha Bhuta))\nThe human body is essentially a play of five elements. Your body is 72% water, 12% earth, 6% air, 4% fire, and 6% space. If you understand the mechanics of the five elements within you, you know everything about the whole cosmos.\n\nWater is the largest component because it is the most fundamental element for life. Without the right proportion of water, the body cannot conduct its functions. Earth gives structure and substance. Air moves through you constantly, not just as breath but in every cell. Fire is the transformative principle - digestion, metabolism, the very warmth of life. Space is what makes everything else possible; it is the canvas on which the other elements play.\n\nThese proportions are not arbitrary. They reflect a deeper cosmic harmony. The same proportions appear in other natural systems. Understanding this is key to understanding both the body and the universe.\n\n\n=== NUMBERS TO DECODE ===\n\nElemental composition of the human body:\n  water: 72\n  earth: 12\n  fire: 4\n  air: 6\n  space: 6\n  Notes: These should emerge naturally from some geometric or algebraic\nstructure. Why these specific proportions? Is there a Fano-like\nincidence structure where these numbers appear as counts?\n\n\nEnergy centers in the yogic system:\n  main_chakras: 7\n  total_chakras: 114\n  active_chakras: 112\n  outside_body: 2\n  Notes: 112 = 7 \u00c3\u2014 16. Is there a connection to the 7 points of Fano plane?\nWhat about the Klein quartic's 168 symmetries?\n\n\nCategories in yogic cosmology:\n  categories: 21\n  Notes: 21 = 7 + 7 + 7 = binomial(7,2). Fano plane has 7 lines.\nConnection to Sanskrit grammar's categorization?\n\n\nNumbers in Indian classical music:\n  swaras: 7\n  shrutis: 22\n  melakartas: 72\n  janya_ragas: 484\n  Notes: 72 appears again (melakartas = water proportion).\n22 shrutis - connection to 21+1?\n\n\nRespiratory and cosmic cycles:\n  breaths_per_day: 21600\n  minutes_per_day: 1440\n  Notes: 21600 = 360 \u00c3\u2014 60. Connection to geometry?\n1440 = 12 \u00c3\u2014 120 = Fano connections?\n\n\nBegin your exploration. What mathematical structures might connect these domains?\nFocus especially on explaining why the numbers appear as they do.",
